# FRED Energy Token FRED is on the Stellar network
FRED Energy has now moved to a custom token on the Stellar blockchain (FRED). Our green projects involve novel EV's, a marketplace of alternative energy products that accepts cryptocurrencies alongside traditional methods of payment, Energy device development and Funding Research into Energy devices (FRED). Further projects are looking towards entering the EV charging station market in Asia and the EU with Project Energise, a project aimed at niche EV charging segments where upfont costs are low and offer long term opportunities. 

# UPDATE 2021
In January 2021 the project launched FREDx an ERC-20 token alongside its Stellar based token (FRED) to increase awareness and liquidity of its green energy related projects.<br>
FRED Energy is now a dual blockchain project, a rising trend in projects struggling to gain investment, liquidity, and exposure.<br>
Token supply is 808,000,000 FRED Energy Tokens with the Ticker FRED.<br>
404 Million have been moved to the swap pool. The swap pool of 404M FRED and 404M FREDx will be used
to manage total in circulation ratios where swaps from one side may be halted until deposits from the
other side have taken place. This enables a push pull effect to and from each blockchain.<br>
